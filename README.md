## My process

- At first I linked `style.css` file and Google Fonts with `index.html`. Then added the color guides and initialized the `css` file.

```css
:root {
  /* Primary Colors */
  --dark-cyan: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
  --dark-desaturated-blue: hsl(229, 23%, 23%);
  --dark-grayish-blue: hsl(227, 10%, 46%);
  /* Neutral Colors */
  --dark-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 59%);
  /* Initail font-size */
  font-size: 18px;
}

/* Initalization */
*,
::before,
::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-family: "Kumbh Sans", sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

- After then, added necessary `HTML` code to implement the profile card and after doing this, I added necessary `css` styles to match the design sample.
- Then I added the _background circles_ and wrote necessary `css` styles to match with the design sample.
- Finally I added necessary css `@media-query` rules to follow the mobile-version UI design sample.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By doing this project, first of all I learned how to add multiple circles as background and also position it.
